# A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
# 6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.
